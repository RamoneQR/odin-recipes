    <h2>Pasta Recipe</h2>
    <p>Quick and simple pasta recipe for a relaxed chill meal. Great with a class of wine.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Any king of pasta</li>
        <li>Pasta sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pot of saltwater big enough to accommodate your cooked pasta plus an inch or two of pasta water (for a pound of pasta, you'll want four quarts).</li>
        <li>When it's boiling (you'll see big bubbles in the water and steam rising from the pot), add your pasta</li>
        <li>After it comes to a boil again, set a timer to the minutes specified on the pasta box, adjusting the flame downward if it begins boiling over, which sometimes happens.</li>
        <li>When the timer goes off, drain and rinse the pasta in cool water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>All that's left is adding the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
